# Development ledger

Repository development metadata. Each integrated change made from ChatGPT Work, Codex, Cloud Code or another authorized surface gets one entry. The ledger is outside the shared runtime package. Git history and current file content remain the authority; an entry records intent, provenance and verification limits.

Entry fields: change ID, origin (`human`, `chatgpt-work`, `codex`, `cloud-code` or another named environment), baseline SHA, result SHA, package version change, scope, whether the shared package changed, verification and cross-host state. Use only `synchronized`, `pending`, `unknown` or `not_run` for cross-host state, and `synchronized` only with readback evidence.

- Origin: cloud-code
- Branch: `cloud-code/CC-20261006-01-conditional-research`
- Baseline: `928199aefdd004d36d1d42e45092d1ce002a0854` (main, package 1.10.1)
- Result: `91f80c96445df0120f2415615b849c1dbd0124b0` (package 1.11.0); work-in-progress parent `36ac03d`
- Package version: 1.10.1 -> 1.11.0
- Scope: conditional, trigger-based research gate (roadmap item 1); offline handling for ChatGPT without search and Codex with network disabled
- Shared package changed: yes; 75 changed files, 0 added, 0 removed ([scope](../verification/scope-1.11.0.json))

Verification:

- canonical validator: PASS
- Node CI set 134, motion-quality 9, installer 12, identity 4, GEPA pilot 8 (3 skipped), asset 23: PASS
- install inventory regenerated; local package build: PASS
- host behavior: not_run; 201 planned cases not_run

Cross-host state:

- GitHub: synchronized; `main` fast-forwarded to `391fa79` on owner instruction; [v1.11.0](https://github.com/FrameCoreWorks/framecore-works-creative-studio/releases/tag/v1.11.0) published by workflow 37453689737; 838 blobs and plugin ZIP hash match ([record](../verification/github-publication-1.11.0.json))
- ChatGPT Work: pending; the owner updates the hosted plugin through ChatGPT Work (hosted plugin was 1.10.1 at publication)
- Codex: pending

Notes:

- Preserved skill IDs, complete welcome, automatic language policy, startup menus and vendored snapshots.
- Version 1.11.0 was chosen because an unpublished 1.10.2 exists outside this repository; that 1.10.2 is not part of this history.
- No search, provider call, rendering or media inspection was performed.
