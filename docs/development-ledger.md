# Development ledger

Repository development metadata. Each integrated change made from ChatGPT Work, Codex, Cloud Code or another authorized surface gets one entry. The ledger is outside the shared runtime package. Git history and current file content remain the authority; an entry records intent, provenance and verification limits.

Entry fields: change ID, origin (`human`, `chatgpt-work`, `codex`, `cloud-code` or another named environment), baseline SHA, result SHA, package version change, scope, whether the shared package changed, verification and cross-host state. Use only `synchronized`, `pending`, `unknown` or `not_run` for cross-host state, and `synchronized` only with readback evidence.

Notes:

- Preserved skill IDs, complete welcome, automatic language policy, startup menus and vendored snapshots.

- No search, provider call, rendering or media inspection was performed.
