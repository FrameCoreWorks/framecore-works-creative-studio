# Troubleshooting

This page covers common installation and workflow issues for this Codex workflow skill kit.

## Native Codex Skills

The default route uses [`$skill-installer`](../CODEX_INSTALL.md), not the project CLI.
An existing destination, including a dangling link, blocks fresh installation;
check the active scopes and use [CODEX_UPDATE.md](../CODEX_UPDATE.md) for existing
Skills. Do not delete or rename a Skill to force installation.

For missing Skills, verify the actual host destination and complete saved bundle,
then check discovery on the next turn. No project manifest, config or agent TOMLs
are expected. If a multi-Skill run failed, inspect all destinations before retrying;
earlier copies may already exist. Report partial state and preserve personal files.
If the system installer is unavailable, stop without silently switching routes.

The project CLI diagnostics below apply only to the optional advanced mode.

If you are reporting test feedback instead of fixing the issue yourself, use [Tester Feedback Guide](tester-feedback.md). It gives a short template for environment, prompt, command, screenshot, exact error, and privacy-safe notes.

## Guided Install Fails At A Step

The guided installer runs the safe beginner sequence:

```bash
npm run install:guided -- --target /path/to/your/project
```

It stops on the first failed step. Match the step name to the fix:

- `Repository checks`: use the `npm run check` section below.
- `Doctor preflight`: fix the target readiness issue before installing.
- `Onboarding`: regenerate or repair `framecore.config.json`.
- `Install dry-run`: resolve user-owned file conflicts before real install.
- `Project-local install`: rerun dry-run, then inspect the exact installer error.

The guided installer refuses missing target folders and refuses installing into this kit repo itself. Create or choose the real Codex workspace first, then rerun the command.

## `npm run check` Fails

Run the parts separately to identify the failing gate:

```bash
npm run audit:privacy
npm run validate
npm test
```

Use the failure category to decide the next step:

- `audit:privacy` failure: remove AppleDouble sidecar files, local machine paths, email addresses, secret files, secret-like values, private cloud URLs/IDs, or excluded provider/tool remnants from public source files.
- `validate` failure: a required agent template, skill file, pipeline reference, gate, handoff, artifact template, or text-image policy marker is missing or inconsistent.
- `npm test` failure: inspect the named test and keep fixes focused on the behavior under test.

## `npm pack --dry-run` Fails With A Cache Error

Some local npm caches can fail independently of the package contents. Retry with a temporary cache:

```bash
NPM_CONFIG_CACHE=/tmp/framecore-npm-cache npm pack --dry-run
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
$env:NPM_CONFIG_CACHE = "$env:TEMP\framecore-npm-cache"
npm pack --dry-run
```

If this passes, the package contents are valid and the failure is local npm cache state. Clear or replace the default npm cache before release work.

## `npm run package:audit` Fails

`package:audit` parses `npm pack --json --dry-run` and rejects package file paths that should never ship in the public kit.

Common causes:

- local config files such as `framecore.config.json`
- generated outputs, build folders, caches, logs, archives, or backups
- AppleDouble sidecars such as `._README.md`
- secret-shaped filenames such as `.env`, `.npmrc`, `credentials.pem`, or token files
- unexpected package roots outside the public source/docs/examples/scripts/test set

Fix the package file list or remove the unintended file, then rerun:

```bash
npm run package:audit
```

## Privacy Audit Categories

The privacy audit is intentionally strict for public-source safety. Common categories:

- `APPLEDOUBLE_FILE`: remove macOS metadata sidecars with `npm run cleanup:appledouble -- --apply`.
- `SYMLINK_FILE`: replace symlinked repo files with normal checked-in files. Public-source scans do not follow symlinks.
- `LOCAL_ABSOLUTE_PATH`: replace machine-specific macOS, Linux, Windows, WSL, UNC, or `file://` paths with portable examples.
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS`: remove personal or private emails from source examples and docs.
- `SECRET_FILE_NAME`: remove files such as `.env`, `.npmrc`, private keys, or certificate/key material.
- `SECRET_LIKE_VALUE`: remove API keys, bearer tokens, private key blocks, GitHub/OpenAI/AWS/Google-style tokens, JWT-like values, and similar credentials.
- `PRIVATE_CLOUD_REFERENCE`: remove private Drive/Docs, Notion, Dropbox, SharePoint, Azure blob, S3, or GCS links and IDs.
- `BANNED_TERM`: remove private project names, private agent names, or excluded provider/tool remnants.

Do not paste the sensitive value into an issue or pull request while asking for help. Report only the finding code and affected file path.

## Node Version Is Too Old

The package requires Node.js 20 or newer. Check your version:

```bash
node --version
```

Upgrade Node, then rerun:

```bash
npm run check
```

## Doctor Reports A Preflight Failure

Run doctor before dry-run when you are unsure whether a target workspace is ready:

```bash
npm run doctor -- --target /path/to/your/project
```

Doctor is read-only. It reports missing targets, old Node versions, missing npm, invalid config, missing manifests for update/repair/uninstall, incomplete manifests from interrupted writes, unsafe manifest entries, likely user-owned file conflicts, and managed-file hash drift when the manifest includes hashes. It does not install, repair, back up, remove, or render files.

If doctor passes, still run install dry-run before any real install:

```bash
npm run install:dry-run -- --target /path/to/your/project
```

If doctor reports missing or changed managed files, inspect local edits before running `repair` or `update`, because those modes can recreate FrameCore-managed files and write backups.

If doctor reports an incomplete manifest, a previous install, update, or repair likely stopped after the manifest was written but before all managed files were completed. Review the target workspace, run doctor again, then use `repair` or `update` only after you understand whether local edits should be preserved.

## Target Workspace Does Not Exist

Guided install, onboarding, and project-local install expect an existing Codex workspace folder by default. Create the project folder first or choose the correct existing workspace path.

The lower-level onboarding and install scripts support `--create-target` for intentional folder creation:

```bash
node scripts/onboard.mjs --target /path/to/new/project --defaults --create-target
node scripts/install.mjs --mode dry-run --target /path/to/new/project --create-target
```

In install dry-run mode, `--create-target` only allows the installer to simulate a missing target path. It does not create the folder. Write modes create the target only when `--create-target` is present.

Do not use `--create-target` when you meant to install into an existing project and may have mistyped the path.

## Dry Run Reports User-Owned File Conflicts

The installer refuses to overwrite files that were not previously recorded in `.framecore/manifest.json`.

Typical message:

```text
refusing to overwrite user-owned file: .agents/skills/example/SKILL.md. Re-run with --force only if this is intentional.
```

Recommended response:

1. Open the conflicting file and decide whether it is truly replaceable.
2. If it is user-owned, keep it and do not force the install.
3. If replacing it is intentional, rerun with `--force`.
4. Prefer backing up or moving user-owned content before using `--force`.

## `AGENTS.md` Was Not Replaced

This is expected when the target project already has `AGENTS.md`.

Project-local install preserves the existing project instructions and writes FrameCore instructions to:

```text
AGENTS.framecore.md
```

Ask Codex to read both files, or manually merge the guidance if your project should keep one instruction file.

## Install Warns That `framecore.config.json` Is Missing

The installer can render agents with built-in defaults, but onboarding is recommended first:

```bash
node scripts/onboard.mjs --target /path/to/your/project
```

For default non-interactive setup:

```bash
node scripts/onboard.mjs --defaults --target /path/to/your/project
```

Then install again:

```bash
node scripts/install.mjs --mode project-local --target /path/to/your/project
```

## Installed Agents Use Neutral Role IDs

Source templates use neutral role IDs by design. Local display names are generated during onboarding and rendered into target `.codex/agents/*.toml` files.

To change local names:

1. Rerun onboarding.
2. Enter custom display names when prompted.
3. Rerun project-local install or repair.

## Config Validation Fails

`framecore.config.json` is validated before rendering or installation. The installer stops before writing managed files when the config is invalid.

Common causes:

- `qa_strictness` is not `light`, `standard`, or `strict`.
- `output_dir` is absolute, points outside the workspace, uses `~`, or is a URL.
- `agent_display_names` contains a role ID that is not in the public role schema.
- nested `delivery`, `hipson`, or `workflow_self_improvement` settings have the wrong shape.

Rerun onboarding to regenerate a valid config:

```bash
node scripts/onboard.mjs --target /path/to/your/project
```

## Codex Does Not Seem To Use The Installed Workflow

Check these items:

- The files were installed into the same project Codex is using.
- The target contains `.codex/agents/*.toml`.
- The target contains `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- The target contains `AGENTS.md` or `AGENTS.framecore.md`.
- Codex has read the current project instructions after installation.

If the project had an existing `AGENTS.md`, explicitly tell Codex:

```text
Read AGENTS.md and AGENTS.framecore.md before continuing.
```

## Context Was Lost Mid-Workflow

Ask Codex to recover from Project State:

```text
Read AGENTS.md before continuing. If this project also has AGENTS.framecore.md, read both files. Then read the latest Project State artifact and continue from its recovery_prompt. Do not skip any unresolved gates.
```

If Project State is missing or stale, ask Codex to reconstruct it from the available artifacts before specialist work continues. The reconstructed state should name the selected route, active roles, completed artifacts, last completed gate, blockers, touched files, next role, next action, and recovery prompt.

## Update And Repair Create Backup Files

When update or repair rewrites an existing managed file, it creates a `.bak` file first. This preserves the previous content for review.

Update and repair also rotate `.framecore/manifest.json.bak` before rewriting the manifest.

If the backup is no longer needed, remove it intentionally after comparing it with the current managed file.

`repair` requires `.framecore/manifest.json` and does not add new paths. Use `update` when you intentionally want the target workspace to receive new FrameCore-managed files from the current kit.

## Uninstall Did Not Remove Everything

Uninstall removes only exact files recorded in `.framecore/manifest.json`. It refuses unsafe paths and directory removals.

Preview first:

```bash
node scripts/install.mjs --mode uninstall --target /path/to/your/project
```

Apply:

```bash
node scripts/install.mjs --mode uninstall --target /path/to/your/project --yes
```

User-owned files, directories, local configs, and files not listed in the manifest are intentionally preserved.

Backup files such as `.bak` are not manifest-managed and remain after uninstall unless you remove them manually.

## External Execution Tools Are Not Installed

This kit is provider-neutral. It installs workflow instructions, agents, skills, templates, gates, and local configuration. It does not install external paid media-provider clients, API keys, endpoint catalogs, or paid execution routes.

If a workflow needs an external tool later, add that integration separately and document the local policy in your project instructions.

## Static Graphics With Visible Text

The public workflow policy says visible text in static raster graphics should be generated directly through the native Codex or ChatGPT image generation path powered by GPT Image 2, in one pass.

Do not work around that rule by generating a blank background and adding text later unless the user explicitly asks for a coded or vector artifact.
