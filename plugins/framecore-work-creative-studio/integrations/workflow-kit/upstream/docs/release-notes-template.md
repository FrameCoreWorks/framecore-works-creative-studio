## Security And Privacy Review

- No secrets, credentials, private URLs, local machine paths, private cloud IDs, generated confidential outputs, or user-specific configs are included.
- No bundled external paid execution providers, provider CLIs, endpoint catalogs, credentials, or API-key setup flows are included.
- The text-bearing image policy still uses native Codex/ChatGPT image generation powered by GPT Image 2.
- Full Hipson remains separate and optional; this kit ships only the lightweight adapter.
