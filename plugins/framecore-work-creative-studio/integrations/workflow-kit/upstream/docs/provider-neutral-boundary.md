# Provider-Neutral Boundary

## Purpose

The Codex workflow skill kit is provider-neutral by default. It installs workflow structure, planning contracts, role files, skills, templates, gates, examples, validation, and privacy checks. It does not install paid execution systems.

This boundary keeps the public kit reusable for different users, teams, toolchains, and budgets.

## What Provider-Neutral Means

Provider-neutral means the kit can plan, route, QA, document, and package creative workflow decisions without bundling an external paid media execution provider.

The kit may create:

- briefs, reference packs, direction contracts, prompt packs, QA reports, manifests, and delivery notes
- tool-neutral execution manifests
- user-readable instructions for later execution
- local configuration generated during onboarding

The kit must not ship:

- external paid media-provider clients
- provider CLIs
- endpoint catalogs
- provider credentials
- API-key setup flows
- provider-specific activation phrases
- private cloud delivery settings
- generated confidential outputs

## Decision Matrix

| Category | Status | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Briefs, references, direction, prompts, QA, and delivery notes | Allowed | Source workflow artifacts are provider-neutral and safe for the public kit. |
| Tool-neutral execution manifests | Allowed | Manifests can describe approved inputs, risks, and handoff needs without bundling a provider client. |
| HyperFrames coded-video workflow knowledge | Allowed | HyperFrames guidance is treated as coded-video planning, scene structure, animation, caption, render QA, and delivery guidance. |
| Native Codex/ChatGPT image generation powered by GPT Image 2 | Conditional | Allowed when the user requests generated static raster graphics and the built-in capability is available. It is the default route for generated posters, social graphics, banners, infographics, thumbnails, ecommerce graphics, storyboard boards, and other bitmap visuals. |
| Full Hipson | Conditional | Full Hipson remains separate and optional; this kit ships only the lightweight adapter and does not clone or activate full Hipson. |
| User-configured external execution tools | Conditional | Users may configure local tools in their own workspace, outside this repo and outside the default install path. |
| Bundled paid media-provider clients, provider CLIs, endpoint catalogs, provider credentials, and API-key setup flows | Forbidden | These do not ship in the public kit and should stop a release if introduced. |
| Private cloud delivery settings or generated confidential outputs | Forbidden | These remain user-local and must not enter public source, examples, package contents, or release notes. |

## Built-In Chat Image Exception

The static raster and text-bearing image policy is an intentional built-in capability boundary, not an external paid provider integration.

The policy source of truth is split deliberately: [Static Raster And Text-Bearing Image Policy](text-image-policy.md) is the human-readable source and `config/text-image-policy.json` is the machine-readable config source. This section only explains how that exception fits inside the provider-neutral boundary.

When the user asks for a generated static raster graphic, the workflow should use native Codex or ChatGPT image generation powered by GPT Image 2 by default when that capability is available. Do not silently replace this with Python-generated artwork, SVG, HTML/canvas, Sharp/composited PNG, or other coded artwork unless the user explicitly asks for a coded, vector, template, or editable source artifact.

When a static raster graphic needs visible text, the final visible text belongs in the generation prompt and should not be added later with overlays unless the user explicitly asks for a coded or vector artifact.

## Coded Video Boundary

HyperFrames is treated as coded-video workflow knowledge. It can guide scene structure, animation timing, captions, overlays, render QA, and delivery manifests.

The public kit does not treat HyperFrames guidance as a paid external media-provider bundle. Any actual rendering runtime remains user-selected and local to the user's project.

## Hipson Boundary

The included Hipson Adapter is lightweight. It creates research maps, internet mapping packets, bounded instruction packets, review packets, and execution packets inside this workflow.

Full Hipson remains separate and optional. Users can connect the full Hipson repository later if they want broader repository scanning, delta reviews, sidecar agents, full knowledge packs, cross-repo orchestration, CLI commands, and complete Hipson workflow assets.

## User-Configured Extensions

Users may add their own external tools in their own workspaces. Those integrations should stay outside this public kit unless they remain optional, provider-neutral, credential-free, and safe for public distribution.

When a user adds a local extension, document it in that user's project instructions, not in the public kit source.

## Release Gate

Stop a public release if it adds bundled external paid execution providers, provider credentials, provider CLIs, endpoint catalogs, API-key setup flows, private cloud delivery settings, or provider-specific activation paths.

Keep this boundary aligned with:

- `config/provider-neutral-policy.json`
- `config/text-image-policy.json`
- `docs/text-image-policy.md`
- `docs/compatibility.md`
- `docs/release.md`
