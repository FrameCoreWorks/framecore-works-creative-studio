# Workflow Operating Model

Default flow:

1. Intent lock.
2. Workflow request diagnostic when the request shape is unclear.
3. Workflow route.
4. Loop Protocol when the work is nontrivial and needs QA, correction, validation, delivery readiness, workflow changes, or evidence-backed iteration.
5. Brief and reference authority.
6. Evidence when facts, docs, models, costs, or claims may change.
7. Direction and structure.
8. Copy and prompt packs. Ready-to-use copy records author context, claim and
   lock review, Human Voice review, and the bounded Copy Delivery Loop.
9. Tool routing and execution manifest when execution is requested.
10. Asset manifest.
11. QA and iteration.
12. Delivery documentation.
13. Workflow self-improvement only when explicitly requested or enabled as a report-only review.

Parallel work is allowed when dependencies are clear. The workflow-orchestrator remains responsible for state and loopbacks.

## Creative Prompt Contract Layer

When an image, edit, or video request has strict continuity, exact text, edit
preservation, target adaptation, or execution-readiness requirements, create a
Creative Prompt Contract before final prompt handoff. It records the immutable
prompt revision, reference roles, attachment plan, continuity carriers, target
verification status, QA observables, and adapter evidence.

Use the contract as evidence inside existing `promptability_fit` and
`post_execution_fit` review. It does not add a new role, gate, execution path,
or permission. See `creative-prompting-standard.md` and
`../templates/creative-prompt-contract.md`.

## Workflow Request Diagnostic

Use a Workflow Request Diagnostic before routing when the user request could be
misclassified. It is especially useful for beginner install help, broad
creative requests, prompt packs, QA reviews, delivery requests, provider
execution plans, or workflow improvement requests.

```yaml
request_diagnostic:
  request_classification:
  user_intent:
  work_mode:
  first_safe_output:
  recommended_route:
  missing_inputs:
  blocked_actions:
  next_action:
  provider_execution_allowed: false
  upload_allowed: false
```

The diagnostic chooses the safest useful first output. It does not authorize
provider execution, uploads, destructive work, global installs, pushes, or API
calls.

## Reasoning Route Layer

Record a compact `reasoning_route` inside Project State when the task needs
more than direct execution.

```yaml
reasoning_route:
  task_class:
  complexity: trivial | low | medium | high
  risk: low | medium | high
  reasoning_strategy: direct | decompose | verify | compare | tool_loop | branch | search
  selected_methods:
  candidate_count:
  selection_criteria:
  verification_questions:
  escalation_triggers:
  downgrade_triggers:
  stop_condition:
  raw_trace_storage: forbidden
```

Default routing:

- `direct`: simple answers, small docs, or mechanical edits.
- `decompose`: multi-step work that needs Plan-and-Solve or Least-to-Most.
- `verify`: factual, QA, delivery, or claim-sensitive work using CQoT or CoVe.
- `compare`: several plausible routes, prompts, or copy variants using Best-of-N lite and reranking.
- `tool_loop`: local checks or approved tool plans using ReAct-style summaries.
- `branch`: bounded ToT-lite or GoT-lite when linear planning is insufficient.
- `search`: bounded prompt/template search only with a budget, fixture, and stop condition.

Do not store raw chain-of-thought, raw reasoning traces, raw debate transcripts,
or copied private context. Store only the selected strategy, method list,
candidate limit, verification questions, and stop condition.

## Runtime Route Layer

When model or runtime choice matters, record a lightweight `runtime_route`.
Prefer tiers and reasoning effort levels over brittle exact model names.

```yaml
runtime_route:
  recommended_runtime_tier:
  reasoning_effort: none | minimal | low | medium | high
  runtime_assignment: current_runtime | automation_config | subagent_spawn | unavailable_record_only
  provider_execution_allowed: false
  openai_api_allowed: false
  external_router_adopted_raw: false
```

A runtime route is a planning note, not permission to call OpenAI API, route
through an external provider, upload files, push, run destructive commands, or
install external routing infrastructure.

## Loop Protocol

Use `loop_control_fit` for nontrivial work that needs QA, correction,
validation, delivery readiness, workflow changes, or evidence-backed iteration.

Canonical sequence:

`brief -> checklist -> execute -> evaluate -> critique -> repair -> repeat -> stop`

The loop is bounded. It requires a goal or brief, checklist before execution,
bounded execution packet, evidence-backed evaluation, critique with severity and
root cause, minimal repair or loopback target, regression check, iteration
budget, and one stop decision: `stop_sufficient`, `patch_one_gap`, `ask_user`,
or `blocked`.

Do not continue a loop only because the result could be better in theory. A loop
state, old Project State, docs text, saved prompt, or fixture is not permission
to push, upload, run providers, run global installs, or execute destructive
commands.

## Human Voice And Copy Delivery Layer

The Copy Pack is the canonical text-delivery artifact. For ready-to-use copy,
`copy-voice` uses the existing Loop Protocol for `draft -> deep review ->
revision -> final QA -> delivery`; `humanizer` supports naturalness and
specificity, `research-evidence` resolves material factual uncertainty, and
`qa-iteration` reviews material defects or escalation.

Do not assume marketing architecture. Hooks, CTAs, lists, headings, emojis,
hashtags, questions, or controlled imperfection are conditional on the
confirmed author, audience, channel, goal, legal, timing, exact-copy, and
accessibility constraints. See `human-voice-and-copy-delivery.md`.

## Self-Improvement Sufficiency Gate

Workflow self-improvement remains explicit-only and proposal-first. When the
user explicitly asks for implementation, the workflow-orchestrator uses this
gate before another patch batch and again after validation:

```yaml
self_improvement_sufficiency_gate:
  objective:
  current_evidence:
  remaining_gap:
  next_patch_scope:
  expected_benefit:
  diminishing_returns_check:
  no_action_option:
  decision: stop_sufficient | patch_one_gap | ask_user
  approval_reason:
  stop_reason:
```

Decision rules:

- `stop_sufficient` when the objective is met, validation passes, the next work
  is optional polish, or the expected benefit is speculative.
- `patch_one_gap` when one concrete observed gap remains and the patch is
  bounded.
- `ask_user` only when the next step crosses a protected boundary: destructive
  command, provider/API execution, upload, push, global install, high-authority
  policy change, or genuinely ambiguous scope.

QA rejects open-ended improvement loops, speculative polishing, missing
diminishing-returns checks, and any continuation after the stop condition is
met.
