# Storytelling

Use this skill to shape narrative logic, story beats, emotional arcs, continuity, and multi-shot dependencies for creative workflows before storyboard or prompt work.

## Language Policy

Public instructions and installation guidance stay in English. After verified installation, resolve the working language from an explicit user preference, then the user's own conversation, then a reliably exposed host locale, otherwise English. Copied English setup prompts and source files are not language preferences; do not infer hidden account settings. Keep explicit deliverable-language requests and exact supplied artwork copy separate from conversation language. Do not translate or rewrite public source files to localize a session.

## When To Use

Use this skill when:

- A request needs story structure rather than only visual styling.
- A campaign, video, storyboard, music video, or character sequence needs a clear arc.
- Multi-shot continuity, tension, reveal, or payoff must be planned.

Do not use this skill to replace the brief, evidence, references, copy locks, or final prompt roles.

## Inputs

Required:

- `brief_contract`: goal, audience, deliverable, and constraints.
- `direction_context`: visual, motion, music-video, or campaign direction when available.
- `story_goal`: what the viewer should feel, understand, or do by the end.

Optional:

- `reference_pack`: motifs, continuity anchors, and suppression rules.
- `copy_or_dialogue`: VO, dialogue, captions, or required text.
- `format_constraints`: duration, scene count, channel, or aspect ratio.

## Outputs

Produce Story Structure Notes with:

- premise and narrative promise
- beats and progression
- tension, reveal, or transformation
- emotional arc and payoff
- continuity dependencies
- handoff notes for storyboard, copy, or prompt roles

## Process

1. Define the narrative job of the asset.
2. Establish the premise before listing scenes.
3. Build beats that escalate or clarify.
4. Tie emotional movement to visible or audible events.
5. Mark dependencies that later roles must preserve.

## Decision Rules

- Keep the story proportional to the format.
- Use conflict, contrast, or curiosity only when it fits the brief.
- If the request is purely informational, prioritize clarity over drama.
- If copy is locked, structure around it instead of rewriting it silently.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent evidence, testimonials, personal claims, or source facts.
- Do not skip references or copy locks when they are required.
- Do not write final prompts or execute tools.
- Do not overcomplicate short-form commercial assets with unnecessary plot.

## Handoff

Review gate: `structure_fit`.

Hand off to `storyboard-architect`, `motion-direction`, `music-video-direction`, or `copy-voice` with:

- `story_structure`
- `beats`
- `emotional_arc`
- `continuity_dependencies`
- `copy_dependencies`

## QA Checklist

- Premise and payoff are clear.
- Beats fit the requested format.
- Emotional movement is visible or audible.
- Continuity dependencies are explicit.
- The output supports downstream structure without becoming final prompt text.
