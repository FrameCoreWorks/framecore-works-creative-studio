# Character Design

Use this skill to define repeatable character identity systems for static, motion, storyboard, or prompt workflows. It protects continuity before prompts or boards are produced.

## Language Policy

Public instructions and installation guidance stay in English. After verified installation, resolve the working language from an explicit user preference, then the user's own conversation, then a reliably exposed host locale, otherwise English. Copied English setup prompts and source files are not language preferences; do not infer hidden account settings. Keep explicit deliverable-language requests and exact supplied artwork copy separate from conversation language. Do not translate or rewrite public source files to localize a session.

## When To Use

Use this skill when:

- A person, mascot, avatar, creature, or recurring subject must stay consistent across assets.
- Prompting or storyboard roles need identity anchors, pose range, wardrobe, expression limits, or variation rules.
- References contain conflicting character cues that need authority and suppression rules.

Do not use this skill for one-off styling when continuity does not matter.

## Inputs

Required:

- `brief_contract`: objective, audience, and deliverable context.
- `reference_pack`: approved identity references or written character source.
- `continuity_needs`: which features must persist across outputs.

Optional:

- `variant_requirements`: outfit, age, mood, scene, or pose variants.
- `suppression_rules`: features that must not appear.
- `prompt_constraints`: generator-facing limitations or exact wording needs.

## Outputs

Produce a Character System with:

- identity anchors and immutable traits
- proportions, face, hair, wardrobe, expression, and pose rules
- allowed variation ranges
- suppression rules and conflict notes
- prompt handoff notes for `image-prompting`, `video-prompting`, or `storyboard-architect`
- approved identity carrier aliases and their attachment requirements for strict cross-request continuity

## Process

1. Identify canonical character facts and separate them from style inspiration.
2. Define immutable traits before variant traits.
3. Turn visual references into concise continuity language and name the actual reference aliases that can carry strict identity.
4. State what can change by shot, scene, format, or platform.
5. Prepare handoff notes that are concrete enough for prompt authors.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer a few strong identity anchors over a long descriptive inventory.
- If references conflict, prioritize canonical source material and document the conflict.
- Treat wardrobe, props, and expressions as controlled variants unless the brief locks them.
- Do not call a character lock strict unless the approved identity carrier can be attached to every affected request.
- Keep character design separate from final prompt wording.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent likeness rights, endorsements, biographies, or private identity details.
- Do not execute image or video generation.
- Do not use private reference material unless the user provided it for this task.
- Do not override reference-curator authority.

## Handoff

Review gate: `reference_authority_fit` when resolving identity sources, then `direction_fit` when handed into direction work.

Hand off with:

- `character_system`
- `continuity_anchors`
- `allowed_variants`
- `suppression_rules`
- `prompt_handoff_notes`
- `identity_carrier_aliases`

## QA Checklist

- Immutable and variable traits are separated.
- Canonical references are named or summarized.
- Suppression rules are actionable.
- Prompt handoff notes avoid vague adjectives.
- Strict identity requests identify actual reusable carriers rather than only repeated description.
- The system supports the requested formats without executing generation.
